# MUR - Mesa-Freeworld for Manjaro

## This is a simple python script that can be used to download Mesa packages directly from Arch Linux servers to an installation of Manjaro. The original objective is to return proprietary codecs that Manjaro as an enterprise distribution cannot ship due to restrictive licences and codecs.

## Be aware of this before running this script for the first time: it is as automated as possible to be used later in a graphical interface. When running the script, the downloaded files will be temporarily stored in /tmp and deleted once the script has finished.

## If you are seeking for a more granular approach to user choice, consider [Mr-nUUb's](https://github.com/Mr-nUUb/manjaro-mesa-freeworld) fork.

## Instructions:
1. Download the file.
2. Make executable with: `chmod +x ./mesa-freeworld.py`
3. Run it with: `./mesa-freeworld.py`
