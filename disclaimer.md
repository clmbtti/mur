I am owner and user of an AMD card and the script simply pulls in arch Mesa packages with hardware acceleration to a Manjaro installation, using YES to pass confirmation to pacman.

It should go without saying, but any use of the archive is your responsibility.

In no event shall the packager be hold liable for your use of this package.

If you decide to use this script - you acknowledge and confirm that your use falls within applicable licenses from any intellectual property owner.
